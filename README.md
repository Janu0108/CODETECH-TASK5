Library Management System

The system supports adding new items to the library, checking out and returning items, managing overdue fines, and searching for items by various criteria.

Features:
Add Items: Users can add new items to the library. Each item has a title, author, category, and type (e.g., book, magazine, DVD).

Check Out Items: Users can check out items from the library. Checked-out items are assigned a due date (14 days from the current date), and their status is updated accordingly.

Return Items: Users can return items to the library. The system calculates overdue fines based on the number of days past the due date. If an item is returned late, the overdue fine is displayed.

Search Items: Users can search for items by title, author, or category. The search function returns a list of matching items.

Display All Items: Users can view all items currently in the library, including their status and due date.
